RackPlannerAndroid
==================

Port of RackPlanner to Android (unfinished). The target is v2.2 android-8.

The idea here is to use the SD card to store module zips and RackPlanner racks in the exact same way the desktop version of RackPlanner uses the local drive. 

So it's probably best to try RackPlanner first and see how it works

I got all the graphics working for the Android. You can try it (the apk is in the /bin folder). 

You should see a rack with a single module when you run the program. You can fling the rack around, zoom, drag and drop the module, etc. 

I lost interest when it came time to work out the menus for file open, save, etc. 

I'm not convinced there is a need out there for people to use RackPlanner on the Android. Mobile devices seem better suited for online apps.

In any case, there are a lot of hand coded graphics tricks here, mainly because I wanted to support the broadest range of Android devices. The code is an improvement on the regular RackPlanner code, I think.

This is my first and only Android project.
